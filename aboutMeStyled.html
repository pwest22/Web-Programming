    Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Phillip West, and I am a senior at Kent State University.
    I am currently studying to receive a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and have a concentration
    in Game Development. I am very passionate about the video game industry, both since I am pursuing
    a degree in Game Development as well as a personal dream to create my own independent game studio.
    Video games were integral to my upbringing and meeting the most important people in my life.
    Below you will find a list of some of my hobbies, interests, skills, and past employments.
